Add the lime juice, pepper vodka, black pepper essential oil and the sugar and process for an additional 5 to 10 seconds. Pass the mixture through a fine mesh strainer and place in the refrigerator to chill until the mixture reaches 40 degrees or below, approximately 2 to 3 hours.  

2. Process the sorbet in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions, approximately 20 to 25 minutes. Place in the freezer for 3 hours or overnight, before serving.
