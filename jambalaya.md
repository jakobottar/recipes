# Jambalaya 
by Devyn Cyphers

## Ingredients
* 3 Celery Sprigs (even if you don't like it)
* 2 Bell peppers (any color)
* 1 Yellow Onion (1 large or 2 small)
* 1 ½ sticks Butter
* 1 small can of tomato paste
* 1 large can crushed tomatoes
* Garlic, minced (2-6 cloves depending on taste)
* long grain rice (1 cup-ish depending on serving)
* Andouille sausage (more if you only have one meat)
* Any other meat, Optional (shrimp, chicken, chuck steak)
* Old Bay seasoning
* Green onions
* Chicken stock
* Black pepper
* Kosher salt

## Directions
1. First I make the Mirepoix. Chop the onion and bell peppers into small cubes about 1/4in - 1/2in size. The celery I usually slice thin so it cooks down and you don't get a big bite of celery.

2. If your sausage is in link form I would chop it now.
I normally cut the links into 4ths then chop to make cubes. Sometimes you can find andouille in ground form, both are good.

3. I prepare a large pot or preferable a ceramic coated dutch oven by bringing it to a medium heat. Add a stick of butter, once it is melted the pot is hot enough to add the vegetables. I Soften them and stir often, the goal is to soften and cook down but not caramelize them.

4. Once the vegetables are soft I add in the meat. Keep stirring, the goal is to not let anything get stuck to the bottom. If the pot starts getting louder or things want to stick I will add more butter or olive oil.

5. Once the meat looks good I will add in the tomato sauce and paste. Giving it a good stir to mix the sauce but the tomato will start to burn if left alone. I add in some chicken stock to stop this from happening. Now add seasonings to taste, be liberal with the Old Bay seasoning. Some recipes say to add bay leaves but I think it is more hassle than it is worth.

6. The last step is to now add in the rice. I will then top off the pot with chicken stock so it is about ¼ in above the rice. The goal is to have enough moisture that the rice doesn't stick to the bottom so if you think it needs more add more.

7. I then cover and simmer until the rice in tender. Covering will help the rice cook faster but you still need to stir every once in a while. If you do end up with burn on the bottom of the pot it's still okay but make sure you don't scrape it off! Doing so will just add burned bits to the rest of the dish.

## Notes
This is a very forgiving recipe to experiment with. The core of every Cajun dish is Celery, Onion and Bell peppers. It is a Mirepoix variant called the Holy Trinity with a ration of 2:1:1 with mainly onion. Andouille Sausage is a staple to the dish with other meats normally being added as well.
