# Pumpkin Yeast Bread
by [King Arthur Baking](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/pumpkin-yeast-bread-recipe)

## Ingredients
* 2 tablespoons instant or active dry yeast
* 1/2 cup (113g) lukewarm milk
* 2 large eggs
* 1 1/2 cups (340g) puréed pumpkin, either fresh or canned
* 2 tablespoons (25g) vegetable oil
* 6 1/2 cups (780g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
* 1/2 cup (106g) brown sugar, packed
* 2 1/2 teaspoons salt
* 1/2 teaspoon ginger
* 1/2 teaspoon cardamom

## Directions
1. Place all of the ingredients into a large bowl, and mix and knead — by hand, using a mixer, or in a bread machine set on the dough cycle — to make a smooth, soft dough.

2. Put the dough into a lightly greased bowl. Cover and let it rise until doubled, about 60 to 75 minutes.

3. Gently deflate the dough, and turn it out onto a lightly oiled work surface. Divide it in half.

4. Shape each half into a loaf, and place in lightly greased 9" x 5" loaf pans. Alternatively, shape half into a loaf, and the other into 12 to 16 rolls, which can be placed into two 8" round pans, or into a 9" x 13" pan. Or, simply shape all of the dough into 24 to 32 rolls.

5. Cover the pan(s) and let the loaves/rolls rise until almost doubled, about 45 minutes. Toward the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350°F.

6. Bake the bread for 30 to 35 minutes, or until its crust is a deep golden brown, and a digital thermometer inserted into the center registers about 190°F. Bake the rolls for about 20 minutes, until golden brown.

7. Remove the bread from the oven, and turn it out onto a rack to cool. Store completely cool bread or rolls well-wrapped, at room temperature, for several days; freeze for longer storage.
