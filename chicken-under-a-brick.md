# Chicken Under a Brick
by [Bon Appetit](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/chicken-under-a-brick-in-a-hurry)

## Ingredients
### Chicken
* 4 skin-on, bone-removed chicken thighs (about 1.5 lb total)
* Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
* 1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil

### Pesto Verde and Assembly
* 1 oil-packed anchovy fillet
* 1 garlic clove, smashed
* 1 tsp. kosher salt, plus more
* ½ cup parsley leaves with tender stems
* ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 Tbsp. sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar
* 1 tsp. Dijon mustard
* ½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
* 3 scallions, white and pale green parts only, thinly sliced

## Directions
### Chicken
1. Remove bones and season chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. 

2. Pour oil into a medium cast-iron skillet. Place chicken in pan skin side down (it’s okay if the pieces touch, but make sure they don’t overlap). 

3. Heat pan over medium-high and place a prepared brick on top of each piece (or, place a sheet of foil over chicken, then set a second cast-iron skillet on top). Cook chicken, checking halfway through to make sure skin isn’t taking on color too quickly and reducing heat to medium if needed, until skin is deep golden brown and crisp and flesh is almost completely cooked through, about 10 minutes.

### Pesto Verde and Assembly
1. While chicken is cooking, place anchovy, garlic, and 1 tsp. salt in a mortar and use pestle to pound to a paste, about 1 minute. 

2. Add parsley and continue to pound until completely pulverized, about 2 minutes. (Alternately, grate garlic and finely chop anchovy and parsley, then mix together in a medium bowl.) 

3. Mix in oil, vinegar, mustard, and red pepper flakes with pestle, then add scallions. Taste and season with more salt, if needed.

4. Carefully remove bricks (foil will be greasy) and check chicken. There should be only a hint of medium-rare flesh on the thickest part of the thigh. Using a thin spatula, release chicken skin from pan and turn onto flesh side. Remove from heat and let sit to finish cooking through, about 1 minute.

5. Spoon some pesto verde onto a platter. Top with chicken, skin side up, and spoon more pesto over (but don’t cover up all that beautiful crisp skin you just created!).
