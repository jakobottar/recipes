# Oat Wheat Bread 
Makes 2 loaves

## Ingredients
* 360 g (3 cups) bread flour
* 340 g (3 cups) whole wheat flour
* 100 g (1 cup) oats + more for top
* 70 g (⅓ cup) brown sugar
* ⅓ cup oil
* 2 cups warm water
* 1 Tbsp yeast
* 2 tsp salt

## Directions
1. Measure all ingredients into a bowl of a mixer

2. Mix for 1-2 min at low speed, add additional flour until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Continue mixing for 10 min.

3. Note: wheat flour absorbs water more slowly than white flour, so aim for a wetter dough.

4. Place dough in an oiled bowl and turn to coat the surface, cover with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in size.

5. Divide the dough and shape loaves (makes two loaves), let rise until dough is about 1 inch above the rim of the pans, usually 1 hour.

6. Brush with milk and top with oats (optional)

7. Bake at 350° for 35 min. Let cool in pans for 5 min then turn out and let cool completely before cutting.
