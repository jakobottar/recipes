Sub mirin for red miso and cut the soy sauce to 3 T for a miso soup

## Ingredients
* 1 lb. large peeled, deveined shrimp
* 1 sheet kombu 
* 1 small bunch mustard greens, kale, mature spinach, or Swiss chard
* 10 scallions
* 1 1" piece fresh ginger
* Kosher salt
* 1 1-oz. package bonito flakes
* ¼ cup mirin
* 5 Tbsp. soy sauce, plus more for drizzling
* 1 Tbsp. toasted sesame oil, plus more for drizzling
* 4 large eggs
* 8 oz. soba noodles
* 1 Tbsp. toasted sesame seeds

## Directions
### Broth
1. Soak 1 sheet kombu in 8 cups water in a large Dutch oven until soft and flexible, 15–20 minutes. 

2. While kombu soaks, remove leaves from your greens, wash, and coarsely chop. Thinly slice 10 scallions; set aside about one-third for serving. Peel 1 1" piece ginger. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. 

3. 4. After kombu has soaked, turn heat to medium. Once you see small bubbles around the edges, use tongs to remove kombu. Avoid bringing the water to a boil—it might make your dashi bitter. 

5. Add 1 1-oz. package bonito flakes, bring to a boil, and turn off heat. Gently push bonito flakes to submerge, then let stand 2 minutes without stirring. Carefully pour through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium bowl or large measuring cup, being sure to strain out any lingering fish flakes. 

6. After finishing the dashi, wipe out Dutch oven and return to medium heat. Add chopped greens, remaining two-thirds of scallions, and ½ tsp. salt. Using a Microplane, grate in ginger. Pour in ¼ cup water and stir to combine. Cover and cook until greens are wilted, 4–5 minutes.

7. Add dashi, ¼ cup mirin, 5 Tbsp. soy sauce, and 1 Tbsp. toasted sesame oil and bring to a gentle simmer.

### Eggs and Noodles
1. Carefully lower 4 large eggs into boiling salted water (not the dashi mixture) and set a timer for 6½ minutes. Fill up a small bowl with ice water. Immediately plunge eggs into ice bath when your timer goes off. This halts their cooking, keeping them in that gooey yolk state you're looking for. Let cool, then peel.

2. Return salted water to a boil and add 8 oz. soba. Cook 4 minutes, then drain and rinse with cold water. Divide noodles among shallow bowls.

### Finishing Up
1. Pinch tails off shrimp; season with salt. Add to pot and remove from heat. The shrimp will turn bright pink in the residual heat of the broth, a sign that they’re cooked through. Taste and add more salt if needed.

2. Divide broth among bowls with noodles. Slice eggs in half as you add to bowls. Drizzle yolks with sesame oil and soy sauce. Sprinkle with reserved scallions and toasted sesame seeds.
