# Mary Berry's Scones
by [Mary Berry](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/tea_time_scones_77839)

## Ingredients 
* 450 g self-raising flour
    - 450 g AP flour
    - 5 ⅝ tsp baking powder
    - 1 tsp salt
* 2 level tsp baking powder
* 50 g sugar
* 100 g butter, softened, cut into pieces
* 2 eggs
* a little milk

## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 425° F. Lightly grease two baking trays.

2. Put the flour, baking powder and sugar in a large bowl. Add the butter and rub in with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.

3. Crack the eggs into a measuring jug, then add enough milk to make the total liquid 300ml/10fl oz. Stir the egg and milk into the flour – you may not need it all – and mix to a soft, sticky dough.

4. Turn out onto a lightly floured work surface, knead lightly. Roll out to a rectangle about 2cm/¾in thick.

5. Cut into as many rounds as possible with a fluted 5cm/2in cutter and place them on the prepared baking trays. Brush the tops of the scones with a little extra milk, or any egg and milk left in the jug.

6. Bake for 12–15 minutes, or until the scones are well risen and a pale, golden-brown colour. Lift onto a wire rack to cool. Eat as fresh as possible.

7. To serve, split the scones and serve with strawberry jam on the plain scones along with a good dollop of clotted cream.
