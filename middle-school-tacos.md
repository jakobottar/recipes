# Middle-School Tacos
by [Sam Sifton / NYT](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/baking-powder-biscuits-recipe)

## Ingredients
* 2 tablespoons neutral oil, like canola, peanut or grapeseed
* 1 medium-size yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 2 pounds ground beef
* 2 tablespoons chile powder
* 1 tablespoon ground cumin
* 2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste
* 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper, to taste
* 2 teaspoons cornstarch
* 2 teaspoons smoked paprika (or substitute hot or sweet paprika)
* 1 teaspoon crushed red-pepper flakes, or to taste
* 1 cup chicken broth or beef broth, low-sodium if store-bought
* 12-18 hard taco shells
* Toppings: grated cheese, sliced jalape√±os, chopped tomatoes, shredded lettuce, sour cream, guacamole, etc.

## Directions
1. Place a large skillet over medium-high heat, and add the oil. When it begins to shimmer, add the onion, and cook until softened and starting to brown, approximately 5 to 7 minutes.

2. Add the garlic, and cook for a minute or so to soften, and then the ground beef. Cook until the beef is starting to brown, stirring and chopping with a spoon to break up the meat, approximately 5 to 7 minutes. Pour off excess fat, leaving only a tablespoon or two in the pan.

3. Heat oven to 325. Add the chile powder, cumin, salt, pepper, cornstarch, paprika and red-pepper flakes, and stir to combine. Add the broth, stir, bring to a simmer and cook uncovered until the sauce has thickened slightly, approximately 4 to 5 minutes.

4. As sauce cooks, place taco shells on a sheet pan, and toast in oven until they are crisp and smell nutty. Serve a few tablespoons of meat in each taco, along with whatever toppings you like.
