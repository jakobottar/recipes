# Beautiful Burger Buns

## Ingredients
* 3/4 to 1 cup (170g to 227g) lukewarm water (*I used 180-190g*)
* 2 tablespoons (28g) butter, at room temperature
* 1 large egg
* 3 1/2 cups (418g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
* 1/4 cup (50g) sugar
* 1 1/4 teaspoons salt
* 1 tablespoon instant yeast

## Directions
1. Mix and knead all of the dough ingredients — by hand, mixer, or bread machine — to make a soft, smooth dough.

2. Cover the dough, and let it rise for 1 to 2 hours, or until it's nearly doubled in bulk.

3. Gently deflate the dough, and divide it into 8 pieces. Shape each piece into a round ball; flatten to about 3" across. Place the buns on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet, cover, and let rise for about an hour, until noticeably puffy.

4. Brush the buns with about half of the melted butter.

5. Bake the buns in a preheated 375°F oven for 15 to 18 minutes, until golden. Remove them from the oven, and brush with the remaining melted butter. This will give the buns a satiny, buttery crust.

6. Cool the buns on a rack.

## Notes
For slightly smaller buns, divide the dough into 12 pieces instead of 8. Bake the buns for 12 to 15 minutes, instead of 15 to 18 minutes. And how about "slider buns" — about 3" in diameter? Divide the dough into 24 pieces, and bake for 12 to 15 minutes. 

Brushing buns with melted butter will give them a soft, light golden crust. Brushing with an egg-white wash (1 egg white beaten with 1/4 cup water) will give them a shinier, darker crust. For seeded buns, brush with the egg wash; it'll make the seeds adhere. And, feel free to add the extra yolk to the dough, reserving the white for the wash.
