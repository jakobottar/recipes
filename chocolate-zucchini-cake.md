by [King Arthur Baking Co](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/chocolate-zucchini-cake-recipe)

## Ingredients
### Cake
* 8 tablespoons (113g) unsalted butter, softened
* 1/2 cup (99g) vegetable oil
* 1 3/4 cups (347g) sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 2 large eggs, at room temperature
* 1/2 cup (113g) sour cream, buttermilk, or yogurt, at room temperature
* 2 1/2 cups (298g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
* 3/4 cup (64g) unsweetened cocoa, Dutch-process or natural
* 2 teaspoons espresso powder, optional but tasty
* 3 cups (340g to 510g) shredded zucchini (about one 10" zucchini)
* 1/2 cup (85g) chocolate chips

### Icing
* 1 cup (170g) chocolate chips

## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 325°F. Lightly grease a 9" x 13" pan.
2. In a large mixing bowl, beat together the butter, oil, sugar, vanilla, baking soda, baking powder, and salt until smooth.
3. Beat in the eggs.
4. Stir in the sour cream, buttermilk, or yogurt alternately with the flour.
5. Add the cocoa and espresso powder, mixing until smooth.
6. Fold in the zucchini and 1/2 cup chocolate chips. Spoon the batter into the prepared pan.
7. Bake the cake for 30 to 35 minutes, until the top springs back lightly when touched, and it seems set.
8. To ice the cake, slide the cake out of the oven, sprinkle it evenly with the 1 cup chocolate chips, and return it to the oven for 5 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean.
9. Remove the cake from the oven, and use a cake spatula or rubber spatula to spread the chocolate chips into a smooth glaze. Cool on a rack.

<!-- Notes:
* Don't worry about espresso powder giving this cake any coffee flavor; it's there strictly to enhance the cake's deep-dark chocolate taste, which it does admirably.
* For a slightly thicker, richer frosting: In the microwave or on the stove top, combine 1 1/3 cups (8 ounces) chocolate chips and 7 tablespoons (3 1/2 ounces) half & half, heating until the chocolate softens. Stir to melt the chocolate, and spread over the completely cooled cake. Fat-free half & half is fine; as is liquid coffee creamer — try different flavors for a tasty twist. -->
