# Alma’s White Bread
by Alma Johnson, adapted from King Arthur

Makes 2 loaves

## Ingredients

* 720 g (6 cups) bread flour
* 226 g (1 cup) whole milk
* 250 g (1 to 1 ⅓) cup water
* 50 g (¼ cup) vegetable oil
* 50 g (¼ cup) sugar
* 12 g (2 ½ tsp) salt (see note)
* 4 tsp instant yeast 

## Directions
1. In the bowl of a stand mixer all add the ingredients.

2. Mix and knead, adding enough of the flour to make the dough clean the sides of the bowl. It should feel tacky but not sticky.

3. Knead to make a smooth and elastic dough, about 10 min

4. Place in a greased bowl, cover, and let rise for about an hour.

5. Punch down and form into a ball, let sit for 15 to 20 min.

6. Form into logs, place into greased loaf pans, and let rise until the bread rises about 1 inch above the top of the pan, approximately 1 hour.

7. Bake for 30 min at 375°. 

8. Let cool for 5 min in loaf pans before removing. Completely cool before cutting.

## Notes
I use Morton kosher salt in this recipe, and 12 g is an approximate conversion. Pay attention to your rising time and tweak the salt amount if you're using regular table salt (less salt by volume) or Diamond Crystal (more salt by volume).

This recipe was designed and tested at high altitude where yeast is more active. If you notice your bread is taking a long time to double, increase the amount of yeast. 

When adding them to the bowl, place the salt and yeast on *opposite* sides. Salt limits the yeast growth, so if you dump them in together you could kill most of the yeast before it gets a chance to grow and multiply, which would be sad.

To make this recipe vegan, replace the milk with 250 g water. Milk is more dense than water so you'll need to add more water by weight to get the same hydration.
