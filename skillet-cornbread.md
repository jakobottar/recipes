by [Bon Appetit](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/classic-skillet-cornbread)

## Instructions
* 2 1/2 cups coarse-grind cornmeal
* 1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda
* 1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt
* 1 large egg
* 1 2/3 cups buttermilk
* 2 tablespoons bacon fat, lard, or unsalted butter

## Directions 
1. Preheat oven to 375°. Set dry 10" cast iron skillet over low heat to heat while you make the batter. Whisk cornmeal, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. Make a well in the center and add egg and buttermilk, then whisk vigorously, starting in the center to incorporate egg and working your way out, until dry ingredients are incorporated and batter is smooth.

2. Increase heat to medium-high and add bacon fat to skillet. Swirl to coat bottom and sides of skillet. Whisk batter once more to reincorporate, then pour into skillet and smooth top (batter will sputter around edges).

3. Bake cornbread in oven until the edges are golden brown and the top is golden, cracked in places, and firm to the touch, 25–30 minutes. Let cool in pan at least 5 minutes before cutting into wedges.
