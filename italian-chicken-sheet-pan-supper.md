# Italian Chicken Sheet Pan Supper
by ???

## Ingredients
* 4 whole Boneless, Skinless Chicken Breasts
* 6 whole Roma Tomatoes
* 1 pound Green Beans
* 1 cup Olive Oil
* 1/3 cup Balsamic Vinegar
* 5 cloves Garlic, Minced
* 1 teaspoon Dried Parsley Flakes
* 1 teaspoon Dried Basil Flakes
* 1 teaspoon Kosher Salt
* 1/2 teaspoon Black Pepper
* 2 Tablespoons Finely Mince Fresh Parsley

## Directions 
1. To a bowl or pitcher, add olive oil and balsamic, along with the garlic, parsley, basil, salt, and pepper. Whisk it until it’s emulsified.

2. Place the chicken in a large zipper bag and pour in half the dressing. Seal the bag and set it aside.

3. Halve the tomatoes lengthwise. Trim the ends off the green beans, and place the veggies in a large zipper bag. Pour in the rest of the dressing, then seal the bag and set them aside.

4. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Arrange the chicken and veggies on a sheet pan, leaving the excess marinade behind. Roast in the oven for 25 minutes, shaking the pan once during that time.

5. Variations: Sprinkle ½ cup shredded Parmesan all over the pan as soon as you remove it from the oven. Let it sit a few minutes before serving. Or Serve with crumbled feta cheese all over the top.
