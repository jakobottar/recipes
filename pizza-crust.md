by [King Arthur Flour](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/the-easiest-pizza-youll-ever-make-recipe)

## Ingredients
* 2 cups lukewarm water
* 1 Tbsp sugar
* 1 Tbsp active dry yeast or instant yeast;
* 1 Tbsp salt
* 2 Tbsp olive oil
* 660 g to 720 g (5 ½ to 6 cups)  All-Purpose Flour, enough to make a soft, smooth dough

## Directions
### Make the Crust
1. Dissolve the sugar, yeast, and salt in the lukewarm water and olive oil.
2. Add the flour, starting with 5 cups and adding more as necessary to make a soft, smooth dough.
3. Knead the dough with your mixer until it's smooth and elastic, about 7 to 10 minutes.
4. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl or other container, cover it, and let it rise for 1 to 2 hours, whatever fits your Schedule. Bake with your favorite method. 

### Cast Iron Baking Method

1. Gently deflate the dough, and divide it into three pieces so we get that nice thick spongy crust. Oil and stretch each piece with your hands into a circle to fit a 10” cast iron pan, leaving a lump at the edge as the crust. Let the dough rest to relax it and make it more cooperative if you need. 
2. Preheat your oven to 475°F. While it's heating, get out your toppings, which you've prepared ahead. Some possibilities include sliced pepperoni; sautéed mushrooms, onions, or peppers; cooked meats; olives; anchovies; and grated or shredded low moisture cheese.
3. Get the cast iron pan nice and hot on the stove, adding a Tbsp of olive oil. Remove from heat and drop the dough round into the pan in one go, it will start to cook in the hot pan while we top it, that’s OK.
4. Season crust with a bit of salt, spread pizza or spaghetti sauce lightly over the surface, and let your guests add their favorite toppings. Sprinkle the top with grated cheese and an olive oil drizzle. Peek underneath the crust—the bottom should be golden brown and crisp from residual heat in the skillet. If it’s not, set over medium-low and cook until crust is golden brown, about 3 min.
5. Transfer skillet to oven and bake pizza on top rack until crust is golden brown around the edges and cheese is browned in spots and bubbling all over, 10–14 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes, then top with red pepper flakes and basil. Sprinkle with more salt and drizzle with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil.
