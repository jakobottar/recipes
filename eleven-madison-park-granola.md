# Eleven Madison Park Granola
By New York Times
## Ingredients
* 2 1/4 cups rolled oats
* 1 cup shelled pistachios
* 1 cup unsweetened coconut chips
* 1/3 cup pumpkin seeds
* 1 Tbsp kosher salt (1 1/2 tsp Mortonâ€™s)
* 1/2 cup light brown sugar
* 1/3 cup maple syrup
* 1/3 cup olive oil
* 3/4 cup dried cherries

## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 300. In a large bowl, mix together the oats, pistachios, coconut, pumpkin seeds, and salt.
2. In a small saucepan set over low heat, warm the sugar, syrup, and olive oil until the sugar has just dissolved, then remove from heat. Fold the liquids into the mixture of oats, making sure to coat the dry ingredients well.
3. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat, and spread the granola over it. Bake until dry and lightly golden, 35 to 40 min, stirring the granola a few times along the way
4. Remove granola from the oven, and mix it into the dried sour cherries. Allow to cool to room temp before transferring to a storage container. Makes about 6 cups.
