# Oatmeal
by Daniel Johnson

This is an easy, creamy, rich oatmeal recipe that takes about 15 min. This version serves 1 person but it scales well up to 4 servings at a time

## Ingredients
* ½ cup whole milk
* ½ cup dry oatmeal
* ½ cup water
* Pinch Salt
* ¼ tsp Cinnamon
* 1 tsp butter
* Toppings, such as
    - Brown Sugar
    - Nutmeg
    - Chopped Nuts
    - Fresh Fruit
    - Dried Fruit

## Directions
1. Combine the oatmeal, milk, water, and salt in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally to avoid burning the milk, then reduce to a simmer over low heat. Simmer, stirring often, until the liquid has been absorbed, about 5 min. With about 1 min left, add in the cinnamon.

2. Turn the heat off, add the butter to the top and let sit with a lid on for 5 min.

3. Mix melted butter into the oatmeal, then serve immediately with toppings of your choice. Since the oatmeal was cooked with milk, you won't need any as a topping.
