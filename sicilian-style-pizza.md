# Sicilian-Style Pizza
By [King Arthur Baking Co](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/sicilian-style-pizza-recipe)

## Ingredients
* 4 1/2 cups (542g) King Arthur High-Gluten Flour
* 1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon (8g) Pizza Dough Flavor, optional
* 2 teaspoons instant yeast
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 1 3/4 cups (397g) lukewarm water

## Directions
1. Mix and knead together all of the dough ingredients — by hand, mixer, or bread machine — using just enough water to make a very soft, smooth dough; you may not need all of the water.

2. Allow the dough to rise, covered, for 1 hour. Use immediately; or refrigerate for up to 24 hours to develop the crust's flavor.

3. Use olive oil to lightly coat the bottom and edges of a half-sheet pan (18" x 13").

4. Remove the dough from the refrigerator, transfer it to the pan, and use your hands to gradually stretch it out towards the edges. When the dough starts to shrink back, let it relax, uncovered, for about 10 to 15 minutes, then stretch it again. You'll want the dough to fill the pan, so repeat the relax-stretch process two or three times until it does.

5. Let the dough rise for 1 to 2 hours, until it's noticeably puffy. The longer it's been refrigerated, the longer it's likely to take to rise.

6. Towards the end of the dough's rising time, preheat the oven to 450°F.

7. Bake the untopped pizza crust for 10 to 12 minutes, until it's barely beginning to brown.

8. Remove the pizza from the oven, and top it with the anchovies (if using), cheese, and tomato-onion sauce.

9. Return the pizza to the oven for about 15 to 20 minutes, until the edges are golden brown and the sauce is bubbling.

10. Remove the pizza from the oven, and let it rest for about 10 minutes before serving.
