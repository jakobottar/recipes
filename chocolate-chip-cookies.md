Makes 3 dozen cookies, recipe adjusted for high altitude

## Ingredients
* 3 cups all purpose flour
* ⅞ tsp baking soda 
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 cup butter, softened
* ¾ cup sugar
* ¾ cup brown sugar
* 2 large eggs
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 1 cup chocolate chips

## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350° F
2. In a small bowl, mix the flour, baking soda and salt and set aside.
3. In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugars until light. Beat in eggs and vanilla until smooth. Gradually add flour mixture until combined. Stir into chips.
4. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. 
5. Scoop onto a cookie sheet. Bake for 14 min until lightly browned. The cookies will collapse slightly when cooling so err on the side of underbaked.
