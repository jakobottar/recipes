## Ingredients
* 1½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs
* Kosher salt, to taste
* Black pepper, freshly ground, to taste
* 3 slices thick-cut bacon
* 2 small yellow onions
* 2 cloves garlic
* 4 carrots
* 1 12-ounce can pumpkin beer or other beer you prefer
* 1 cup apple cider
* 1 14-ounce can diced fire-roasted tomatoes with chilies
* 1 tablespoon apple butter or real maple syrup
* 1 tablespoon chili powder
* 2 teaspoons smoked paprika
* 2 sprigs fresh thyme or 2 teaspoons dried thyme
* ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, coarsely chopped
* Cooked rice or egg noodles, for serving

## Directions
1. Season the chicken with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.

2. Coarsely chop the bacon. In a cocotte or Dutch oven over medium heat, cook the bacon for about 5 minutes, until it is crispy. Transfer the bacon to a plate lined with a paper towel. Drain all but 1 tablespoon of the bacon grease. Add the chicken and sear it until it is golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Remove the chicken and set it aside.

3. Thinly slice the onions and grate the garlic. Add the onions and garlic to the cocotte and cook them for 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low.
    
4. Dice the carrots. Add the beer, cider, tomatoes, apple butter, carrots, chili powder, paprika, thyme and cayenne, and season with salt and pepper. Add the chicken. Simmer, partially covered, for 20–30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. Stir in the parsley and bacon.

5. Serve the chicken and sauce over rice or egg noodles.
