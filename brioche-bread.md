by [Binging With Babish](https://www.bingingwithbabish.com/recipes/sweetrolls-skyrim)

## Ingredients
* 510 grams all-purpose flour
* 60 grams granulated sugar
* 14 grams active yeast (10-12 grams instant yeast)
* 15 grams kosher salt
* 4 large eggs, room temperature
* 225 grams high quality unsalted butter, room temperature

## Directions
1. Into the bowl of a stand mixer goes 510 grams of all-purpose flour, 60 grams of granulated sugar, 14 grams of active dry yeast (10-12 grams of instant yeast), and 15 grams of kosher salt. Whisk completely together.
2. Place at the base of a stand mixer and add 4 large room temperature eggs. Fix a dough hook to the mixer mixing and kneading together for 4-6 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and dough hook as necessary until the dough is smooth.
3. With the stand mixer on low speed, add in (1-2 small pieces at a time) 225 grams of high-quality unsalted room temperature butter. After each addition crank up the speed a little bit allowing the butter to fully incorporate into the dough. This will take between 4-8 minutes between each addition of butter.
7. After the last piece of butter has been added and fully incorporated into the dough, crank the stand mixer up to medium speed and knead for 5-8 minutes until it very nearly cleans the sides of the bowl.
8. Once silky smooth, dump the dough onto a non floured surface and work into a smooth taut ball by passing the dough back and forth between each hand pinching the edges against the table.
9. Into a generously buttered bowl, place the dough in seam side down and cover with plastic wrap letting it sit at room temperature for at least 60-90 minutes or until doubled in size. 
10. After 60-90 minutes, blop the dough back onto the countertop, punching it down, giving it a series of folds. Do so by starting at the top of the dough folding in towards the center and repeat working around the dough until 6-9 folds have been completed. 
11. Repeat the edge pinching technique from step 5 then place back into a bowl covered with plastic wrap and let it sit in the fridge between 12-48 hours, or place into a well-buttered bowl letting proof for 1 hour.
12. After removing from the fridge, carefully remove from the bowl then depending on its purpose divide the dough into pieces. Divide in half if making easy brioche bread.
13. Turn the half dough onto a well-floured surface and roll it out into a rectangle, about as wide as the intended loaf pan. Then roll it up lengthwise to fit into the loaf pan hiding the seams underneath the roll before adding to a well-buttered and floured non-stick loaf pan. 
14. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature anywhere from 1 hour and 45 minutes to 2 ½ hours. The loaf should have doubled in size during this time. Poke to make sure the dough doesn’t spring back. 
15. Brush the top with a beaten egg before placing it into a 375°F oven for 45 minutes. Rotate halfway through baking and tinting with foil if it starts to brown too fast. 
16. It is fully done with a hollow sound when thumped on the bottom and when its thickest point reaches an internal temperature between 195°F to 210°F. 
17. Make sure to allow to cool completely, about an hour and a half, before slicing and enjoying.
