Easy, cheap fried rice, perfect for a movie night with the Ocean’s trilogy.

## Ingredients
* 1 cup white rice
* 1 link Polish Kielbasa (14-16 oz) sliced into ¼” coins
* 8 scallions, thinly sliced diagonally
* 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
* 2ish Tbsp neutral oil (peanut/vegetable/canola)
* Salt
* White sugar
* Soy sauce
* 3 large eggs
* Sesame seeds, toasted (for garnish)
* Lime wedges (for serving)

## Directions
1. Steam 1 cup rice (see Rice Cakes for stovetop recipe), toast sesame seeds.

2. Add neutral oil to large skillet or wok, once hot add kielbasa coins. Cook undisturbed until the underside of the coins takes on a deep brown color, about 3 min. Add sliced scallions and garlic, stirring so kielbasa coins flip over. Season with salt. 

3. Dump steamed rice into the pan, with some more oil (A Tbsp or so) 
Add a couple pinches of salt, a splash of soy sauce, and a couple pinches of white sugar. Adjust seasoning to taste. Stir the contents of the pan so the scallions, garlic, and kielbasa are evenly distributed.

4. Wisk 3 large eggs. Make a space in the middle of the pan by pushing the rice to the sides. Add the egg in the strip to create the “egg river”. Let the eggs sit undisturbed for 1–2 minutes, then give them a quick scramble, scraping along the bottom of the skillet. Once the eggs have cooked through, give the whole skillet a stir, distributing the eggs throughout the rice.

5. Serve with sesame seeds and a squeeze of lime juice.
