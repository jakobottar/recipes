# Jakob's Recipe Book
## Formatting
* Markdown file name should be the same as the title written in the file, so a recipe named "Original Chocolate Chip Cookies" would be called `original-chocolate-chip-cookies.md`. This makes finding the file easy if you only have the paper copy.
* Baking recipes should use grams instead of volume whenever possible.
* Include links to original (or adapted from) recipes if possible.
