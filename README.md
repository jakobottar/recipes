# Jakob's Recipe Book

https://github.com/jakobottar/recipes

## Formatting
* Markdown file name should be the same as the title written in the file, so a recipe named "Original Chocolate Chip Cookies" would be called `original-chocolate-chip-cookies.md`. This makes finding the file easy if you only have the paper copy.
* Baking recipes should use grams instead of volume whenever possible.
* Include links to original (or adapted from) recipes if possible.
* Layout is: Title, author, ingredients, directions, notes
    - Ingredients are a list with dots, directions are an ordered list.
* No blank lines between ingredients, blank lines between direction steps.
