by [Betty Crocker](https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/classic-pancakes/77a89da1-fd56-494b-874a-55f9195c1413)

## Ingredients
* 2 eggs
* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 tbsp sugar
* 2 tbsp baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 1/2 cup + 2 tbsp milk
* 4 tbsp vegetable oil or melted butter 

## Directions
1. In medium bowl, beat egg with wire whisk until fluffy. Stir in remaining ingredients just until flour is moistened (batter will be slightly lumpy); do not overmix or pancakes will be tough. For thinner pancakes, stir in additional 1 to 2 tablespoons milk. 

2. Heat griddle or skillet over medium-high heat (375Â°F). (To test griddle, sprinkle with a few drops of water. If bubbles jump around, heat is just right.) Brush with vegetable oil if necessary (or spray with cooking spray before heating). 

3. For each pancake, pour slightly less than 1/4 cup batter onto griddle. Cook 2 to 3 minutes or until bubbly on top and dry around edges. Turn; cook other side until golden brown.
